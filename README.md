# Nix Package Manager Configuration

Note: 

Taken from: https://github.com/pusherofbrooms/ops-tool-belt/tree/main

The main idea is to easily install all packages with one profile command, the above nix flake ensures we can do that. 

1. Install nix package manager as per the instructions at https://nixos.org/download.html

2. Enable nix flakes and experimental tooling.
  - [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) allow for highly configurable environments,
    - See this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw4wJjjQYMU) for more info.
  - Set nix to allow flakes to be used, add "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" to /etc/nix/nix.conf

3. Run `nix profile install .#stdPkgs` to install the packages.

4. Run `nix profile upgrade stdPkgs` to update the profile when you add new packages.

5. Don't forget that some tools may require you to reload the shell
